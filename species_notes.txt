//dir5   Direct fifths – usually either P5→d5 or d5→P5; should be avoided (warning)
//wrong note
//Hidden fifths or octaves (consecutive P5 or P8 in contrary motion)
//Leap from dissonant non-chord tone
//Leap to dissonant non-chord tone
//Leap to perfect interval in similar motion
Leading tone not resolved correctly at cadence
You forgot to raise the leading tone in minor!
//Melody leaps a seventh (warning)
//Forbidden repeated note
//Step back warning
X      Melody crosses below bass
x      Forbidden offbeat notes in first species
//Melody moves by augmented or diminished interval
Leading tone is doubled in bass and melody
The seventh of a V7 moving to I isn’t resolved correctly
//Parallel fifths or octaves
Too many consecutive 3rds or 6ths (up to 4 before error)
//Too many consecutive leaps (up to 4 before warning)
Too many perfect intervals (up to 50% before warning)
Too many leaps (up to 50% before warning)
Melody should have larger range (2nd species+ - melody should cover octave) warning
//Start and end with perfect (modal only)

# Modal Counterpoint
Modal ignores roman numerals
Let's do modal first!

##Fux, according to Wikipedia:
//--The final must be approached by step.
//--If the final is approached from below, then the leading tone must be raised in a minor key (Dorian, Hypodorian, Aeolian, Hypoaeolian), but not in Phrygian or Hypophrygian mode. Thus, in the Dorian mode on D, a C♯ is necessary at the cadence.
//--Permitted melodic intervals are the perfect fourth, fifth, and octave, as well as the major and minor second, major and minor third, and ascending minor sixth.
//--The ascending minor sixth must be immediately followed by motion downwards.
//TRICKY: If writing two skips in the same direction the second must be smaller than the first, and the interval between the first and the third note may not be dissonant. The three notes should be from the same triad; if this is impossible, they should not outline more than one octave. In general, do not write more than two skips in the same direction.
//--TRICKY: The interval of a tritone in three notes should be avoided (for example, an ascending melodic motion F–A–B♮) as is the interval of a seventh in three notes.

##Consonant intervals:
--0 - Octave or unison
--1 - P5
--3 - M6
--4 - M3
-- -3 - m3
-- -4 - m6

##Forbidden melodic intervals
-- +/- 6 - (tritone)
-- +/- 8 or higher (aug or dim)
-- 2 down or -2 up (m7)
-- 5 down or -5 up (M7)
-- 0 unison (2nd & 3rd species)
